## Usage

### YAML configuration

In the repository where you want to perform this action, create the YAML file `.github/labels.yml` (you can also set a [custom filename](#customizing)) that looks like:

```yaml
- name: "bug"
  color: "d73a4a"
  description: "Something isn't working"
- name: "documentation"
  color: "0075ca"
  description: "Improvements or additions to documentation"
- name: "duplicate"
  color: "cfd8d7"
  description: "This issue or pull request already exists"
- name: "enhancement"
  color: "a22eef"
- name: "wontfix_it"
  color: "000000"
  description: "This will not be worked on"
  from_name: "wontfix"
```

* `name`, `color` and `description` are the main [GitHub label fields](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/#parameters)
* `description` can be omit if your want to keep the current one
* `from_name` allow to rename a label from one currently available on your repository

### Workflow

```yaml
name: github

on: push

jobs:
  labeler:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      -
        name: Run Labeler
        if: success()
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-labeler@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          yaml-file: .github/labels.yml
          skip-delete: false
          dry-run: false
          exclude: |
            help*
            *issue
```

With this workflow, the YAML configuration above on a [fresh repository](.res/samples/original.yml), this will:

* Skip `bug` (because same `color` and `description`)
* Skip `documentation` (because same `color` and `description`)
* Update `duplicate` (`color` is different)
* Update `enhancement` (`color` is different, keep current `description`)
* Leave `good first issue` alone (because it matches an `exclude` pattern)
* Leave `help wanted` alone (because it matches an `exclude` pattern)
* Delete `invalid`
* Delete `question`
* Rename `wontfix` to `wontfix_it` and set `color` and `description`

## Customizing

### inputs

Following inputs can be used as `step.with` keys

| Name             | Type    | Description                        |
|------------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| `github-token`   | String  | [GitHub Token](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token) as provided by `secrets`. (default `${{ github.token }}`) |
| `yaml-file`      | String  | Path to YAML file containing labels definitions. (default `.github/labels.yml`) |
| `skip-delete`    | Bool    | If enabled, labels will not be deleted if not found in YAML file. (default `false`) |
| `dry-run`        | Bool    | If enabled, changes will not be applied. (default `false`)  |
| `exclude`        | List    | Newline delimited list of labels pattern(s)/matcher to exclude |

## Keep up-to-date with GitHub Dependabot

Since [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-github-dependabot)
has [native GitHub Actions support](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates#package-ecosystem),
to enable it on your GitHub repo all you need to do is add the `.github/dependabot.yml` file:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Maintain dependencies for GitHub Actions
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
```
